/* v02v02's build of slstatus.
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - You must have the packages "ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols" and "woff2-font-awesome" in order for the glyphs to render.
 *
 * Current output:
 * (From left to right)
 * - A pipe symbol that delineates slstatus from the dwm title bar.
 * - A wifi glyph that changes depending on if users have a connection to the internet or not.
 * - A megaphone glyph that changes depending on how high the volume is.
 * - A calendar glyph, to the right of the calendar glyph is the day of the month.
 * - The time of day, in 12 hour format.
 *
 *
 * Tweaks made:
 * - Created a separate directory called "scripts" within the repo. [/]
 *   (This contains all of the custom scripts I've wrote that slstatus can execute for additional output.)
 *
 * - Changed the value of "unknown_str[]" to make it empty. [config.def.h]
 *   (This is to not have "N/A" outputted to slstatus for the custom scripts that don't usually output anything.)
 *   (e.g. sls-network)
 *
 *
 * Patches applied:
 * - None currently
 *
